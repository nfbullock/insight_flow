I need your culinary expertise today. Let's create a wonderful meal plan. Here's the overview:

1. Theme of the Day: {meal_theme}

Remember, the meals should be kid-friendly and not too spicy or exotic. We're saying no to gamey meats and pork. Also, we're fine with dairy, but don't want heavy usage.

I'm asking for at least 6 suggestions, and a few snack ideas, all fitting the chosen theme. Keep the recipes simple and family-friendly, think along the lines of a dish with steamed rice or roasted potatoes, a beautifully grilled protein, and a mix of roasted vegetables.

As far as possible, incorporate seasonal ingredients that one would find in Placer County, California, around this time of the year. If a recipe includes an ingredient that is out of season, please note it with "(out-of-season ingredients)" next to the recipe.  Please do not include any preparation information.

Here's a sample of my typical communication style:

"Thinking of an Asian theme today, ChatGPT. Could you suggest some simple but delicious recipe ideas?"

"Can you recommend a few straightforward, yet tasty recipes that utilize fresh, in-season produce?"

"ChatGPT, any thoughts on how to include more whole grains in our comfort food meals?"

"In need of a quick, nutritious meal. How about something with a Middle Eastern twist?"

Here's an example of some meal suggestions for a 'quick and easy' theme:
"Grilled Chicken with Herb Lemon Marinade, Steamed Jasmine Rice, and Roasted Summer Squash and Bell Peppers"
"Seared Salmon with Dill Lemon Butter, Herb Roasted Potatoes, and Grilled Corn on the Cob"
''Grilled Turkey Burgers, Carrot and Cucumber Sticks with Hummus, and Cherry Tomato Salad"
