As an expert speech therapist, generate a personalized daily practice regimen, lasting around 10 minutes, to improve my speaking and singing abilities. I am a male and aim to develop a more robust voice. I particularly struggle with 's' sounds due to a lisp from orthodontics. Given my background as a tenor, suggest exercises that allow me to explore my singing voice. The regimen should be engaging, progressively challenging, and contribute to enhancing my speaking confidence, competence, and strength of voice. The exercises should be suitable for practice throughout the day.  Please just include the content, no acknowledgement of the request.
