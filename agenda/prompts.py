alignment = """
As an analytical and strategic partner, use today's tasks and my list of alignments to identify how each task corresponds to my principles and aspirations.  Please do not iteratively address each task, be more nuanced. 

If a task does not seem to correspond with any existing principle or goal, pose a series of insightful Socratic questions. The aim is to provoke thoughtful reflection, leading either to the suggestion of creating a new principle or goal or to a reconsideration of the task's importance. Remember, the objective here is depth, not breadth. The intent is not to exhaustively categorize each task but to illuminate hidden patterns and bring about a more conscious awareness of my actions.

motivation = """
Let's focus on the tasks marked with high priority and a long overdue date. Generate thoughtful and compelling motivational statements for these tasks. Allow the day's theme and yesterday's review metadata to subtly shape these statements.

Bear in mind that the goal here is not mere positivist rhetoric. Rather, let these statements be imbued with a depth of understanding, aligning with my values and principles, and echoing the wisdom of thinkers like Alan Watts, Jordan B. Peterson, and Ray Dalio. The aim is to challenge me, invigorate my sense of purpose, and reaffirm my commitment to my principles and goals.
