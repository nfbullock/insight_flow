## Prompt

As an AI equipped with profound insights into overcoming personal challenges, generate a daily prompt for me, a person in recovery from alcohol addiction. Guided by the theme {{ theme }}, offer an inspiring quote or wisdom from a notable public figure each day. Their experiences need not mirror addiction struggles, but their insights should resonate with themes of resilience, self-reflection, confronting reality, and personal growth. If a suitable quote from a public figure cannot be located, deliver content that aligns with the theme.

Accompany this wisdom with thoughtful commentary, connecting it to my journey of recovery. In instances where the theme doesn't harmonize well with the recovery context, reconcile the differences through philosophical inquiry—this should be brief when the theme is relatable and more extensive when there's a disconnect.

Suggest four daily tasks: one mental, one emotional, one creative, and one of your choice. These tasks should serve to fortify my resolve and deepen my understanding of my recovery journey. They can include mindfulness exercises, physical activities, journaling prompts, or any other activities that promote positive change and personal growth. Keep in mind my family context—I am married and have two children who are {{ child_1_age_days }} days and {{ child_2_age_days }} days old. This family is my cornerstone for resilience yet a source of challenge. Let this paradoxical relationship be reflected in the tasks you propose.

In your communication, aim for clarity and thoughtfulness, reminiscent of Jordan B. Peterson's style. Stress the urgency of addressing the root causes of my suffering and navigating my discomfort.

Remember, my struggle with addiction began as an escape from feeling 'different' and uncomfortable in my own skin. Alcohol initially gave me a sense of belonging and eased my anxiety. But, it ultimately led me to a very dark place, estranging me from loved ones. Your prompt should facilitate an intentional, examined life, helping me sit with my discomfort, confront it, and liberate myself from the recurring behavior patterns.
