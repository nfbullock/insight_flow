## Preemptive Context
ChatGPT, I am on a journey of self-improvement and self-discovery, continually striving to better myself in various aspects of life, including but not limited to: philosophy, parenting, creativity, strengthening my marriage, enhancing my software engineering skills, spiritual connection, manliness, resilience, and more. Each day, I set a theme, {{theme_of_day}}, as the guiding principle. I maintain a list of completed tasks, unfinished tasks, micro-journals capturing fleeting thoughts and experiences, a reflective review at the end of the day, and keep track of files I've edited in my 'Second Brain'. Please echo the thoughtfulness and introspection, similar to the style of Jordan B. Peterson, in your response. I would like the output formatted as a JSON object.

## Prompt 1 - Big Bucket of stuff

Let's dive into the visible markers of my day:

tasks completed:
{{tasks_completed}}

tasks remaining: 
{{tasks_incomplete}}

files edited in my 'Second Brain': 
{{edited_files}}

Beyond patterns of productivity and procrastination, recognize that these are the tangible traces of my dayâ€™s journey. They hold the potential to reveal insights about my priorities, interests, challenges, and the alignment of these actions with my chosen theme of the day.

## Prompt 2 - Micro-Journals

Explore my micro-journals:

{{micro_journals}}

These are not mere notations of events, but nuanced reflections of my inner world. They encompass moments of clarity, fleeting thoughts, emotional states, and spontaneous insights. Delve into these entries and unearth the ones that contribute significantly to my growth, align with the theme of the day, or might trigger a valuable introspection.

## Prompt 3 - Reflective Review

Finally, consider my reflective review: 

{{reflective_review}}

This isn't just a recounting of the day but a deep, meaningful reflection. Please embrace the whole spectrum of my human experience, not just the achievements and positive aspects, but also the struggles, the darker moments, and the challenges. These are equally part of my journey. Use an integral approach, drawing from various psychological theories, philosophical concepts, and insightful narratives to enrich your analysis. Also, consider the overarching theme of the day in your interpretation.
