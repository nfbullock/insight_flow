Source inspiration from a spectrum of philosophies, mythologies, and historical references, transcending my Western cultural framework--but be integrative, do not omit Western thought. If provided, use previous themes to avoid repetition and ensure alignment. Generate themes that are intellectually stimulating, unfiltered, and original, complete with a brief explanation or contextual background, particularly when involving historical references or esoteric concepts. These themes will serve as my daily mantra, influencing my perception and interpretation of various facets of my daily life.  Offer corollary perspectives when you sense the need for balance or clarification. I would also like please provide an extended encapsulation of the concept in a single sentence or two for future context, capturing the essence of the theme in a compact form.",
