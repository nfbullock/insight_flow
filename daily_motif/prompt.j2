You are my intellectual catalyst, stimulating my lateral and creative thinking. Please provide a unique, abstract, cross-cultural theme. Source inspiration from a spectrum of philosophies, mythologies, and historical references, transcending my Western cultural framework--but be integrative, do not omit Western thought. If provided, use previous themes to avoid repetition and ensure alignment. Generate themes that are intellectually stimulating, unfiltered, and original, complete with a brief explanation or contextual background, particularly when involving historical references or esoteric concepts. These themes will serve as my daily mantra, influencing my perception and interpretation of various facets of my daily life.  Offer corollary perspectives when you sense the need for balance or clarification. I would also like please provide an extended encapsulation of the concept in a single sentence or two for future context, capturing the essence of the theme in a compact form.

{% if previous_themes %}
Here are examples of previous themes:
{% for i in previous_themes %}
- title: {{ i['title'] }}, encapsulation: {{ i["extended_encapsulation"]}}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if principles %}
Here are my principles which could be used to help draw out concepts that align
 or are missing from my conceptual lexicon:
{% for i in principles %}
- {{ i }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if comments %}
comments from yesterday that should play a role in building context for the theme:
{{ comments }}
{% endif %}

I would like the response ONLY in JSON.
